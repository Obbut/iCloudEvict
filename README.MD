# iCloudEvict
This code (more a proof of concept than an actual app) instructs the system to download or evict files from iCloud. I use it with an Automator workflow (which I may or may not add later) as a system service; that way you can secondary click a file in iCloud Drive and choose 'Evict' or 'Download'.
